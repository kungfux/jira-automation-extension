# Contributing Guidelines

## Browser Compatibility

All changes to the code should be tested on Firefox, Chrome, and ideally in Edge to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

We use [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) along with [@types/webextension-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/webextension-polyfill) to make this happen.
